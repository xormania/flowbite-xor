/**
 * Keeps what Tom Select shows (UX Autocomplete's controller, on the same `<select>`) in step with the choice of the
 * `<select>` when that choice changes without Tom Select:
 *
 * - A Live Component's re-render copies the server's options, the chosen one marked `selected`, into the select (UX
 *   Autocomplete marks it `data-skip-morph`), and UX Autocomplete sets Tom Select up again only when the options
 *   themselves change. The select then holds the value the server set, and Tom Select would still show the one before.
 *   When the two differ after such a change, Tom Select reads the select again (`sync()`).
 * - A reset of the select's form (a reset button, `form.reset()`, or the `form-reset` controller of the `layouts`
 *   recipe after Back to a GET form) puts back the options the server selected, which Tom Select does not see. The
 *   form is the select's own (`select.form`), which honours the `form` attribute. The `reset` event comes before the
 *   fields are reset, and any listener can cancel it: Tom Select is synced once the event is over (a task later, a
 *   click on a reset button running microtasks between listeners), only when nothing cancelled it, and silently (no
 *   `input` or `change` event, so no Live Component request), as a native field takes back its default. The Tom Select
 *   synced is the one on the select then (`select.tomselect`): UX Autocomplete builds a new one when the options
 *   change. Either way Tom Select is synced only when it shows other values than the select holds, so the reset the
 *   `form-reset` controller has already synced is not synced again.
 * - A copy of the page Turbo took while Tom Select was on screen (a frame visit promoted to history copies the page as
 *   it starts, before UX Autocomplete removes Tom Select) holds Tom Select's markup, which no Tom Select owns: as the
 *   copy connects, that markup is removed, so the field shows the one Tom Select UX Autocomplete sets up.
