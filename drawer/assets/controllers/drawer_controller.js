/**
 * Opens a `Drawer`, a native `<dialog>` docked to a side of the viewport: modal by default (the page is
 * inert, focus is trapped, Escape or a click on the backdrop closes it) or beside the page.
 * Like the `Modal`, a drawer open when its element is moved in the DOM (Turbo, Live re-renders) is
 * reopened on reconnect, and a closed one stays closed. It closes before Turbo caches the page, unless it is inside a
 * `data-turbo-permanent` element, so the copy shown on Back and Forward has it closed and its triggers collapsed; a
 * copy cached open anyway (the page left before `turbo:before-cache`, or a frame visit promoted to history, which
 * keeps the page on screen with the drawer open) is closed when it connects, unless its `open` value says otherwise.
 *
 * @target trigger             The elements opening the drawer, kept in sync through `aria-expanded`.
 * @target dialog              The `<dialog>` element.
 * @value  open                Whether the drawer is open when the controller connects.
 * @value  modal               Whether the drawer opens as a modal dialog.
 * @action open                Opens the drawer.
 * @action close               Closes the drawer.
 * @action closeOnClickOutside Closes the drawer when its backdrop is clicked.
 * @action closed              Syncs the triggers once the dialog has closed.
