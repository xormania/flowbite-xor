 * What a form shows after Back and Forward: a GET form reflects the URL, so it shows the values the server rendered;
 * a POST form (any method but GET) holds the user's work, so it keeps what was typed and picked.
 *
 * On `<body>`, which Turbo replaces on every visit, Back and Forward included (they show the copy Turbo cached, with
 * the fields as the user left them): once the page's controllers have connected, each GET form in the body is reset
 * (`form.reset()` restores every field's `value`, `selected` and `checked` attributes). A form is left alone while the
 * focus is inside it, so text typed before the page's scripts ran is kept, and inside a `data-turbo-permanent` element,
 * which Turbo moves from the page on screen. The widgets follow the form: a `calendar` (and its `date-picker`) resets
 * itself on the form's `reset` event, and a field enhanced by Tom Select (`autocomplete`) is synced from its `<select>`.
 * On a page the server just rendered, a reset changes nothing.
