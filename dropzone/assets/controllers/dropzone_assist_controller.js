/**
 * Works next to Symfony UX Dropzone's controller (`symfony--ux-dropzone--dropzone`) on a `Dropzone`, which it never
 * changes: it reads its targets and listens to its `dropzone:*` events.
 *
 * - Drag-over state: `data-dragging` on the element while a file is dragged over it.
 * - Drops outside the file input (on the list of files, on the preview) are refused, so the browser never opens the
 *   file in the tab and loses the form.
 * - Focus: a pick hides the focused input, so focus moves to the Remove button, whose name ("Remove photo.png") says
 *   what was picked; Remove puts focus back on the input; removing one of several files focuses the next Remove
 *   button, else the last one, else the input. Connecting never moves focus.
 * - A drag that leaves without a drop shows the empty box again: UX Dropzone shows its empty preview instead.
 * - One file stays picked when the element is moved and its controllers reconnect (a `data-turbo-permanent` element
 *   across Turbo visits): UX Dropzone clears the input on every connect, so the file is put back and the input gets a
 *   `change` event (not bubbling), which shows it again.
 * - In a form that is not a GET form (a POST form holds the user's work), one file picked stays picked after Back and
 *   Forward: before Turbo copies the page, the file is kept under a key the zone carries into the copy, and put back
 *   the same way when the copy connects. A frame visit promoted to history copies the page as it starts, before its
 *   `turbo:before-cache`: the zone carries a key from its connect on, and takes a new one after each copy. A GET form, which cannot send files, and a zone outside a form start empty.
 *
 * @target input       The file input.
 * @target placeholder The inside of the box shown before a pick.
 * @target preview     The picked file (one file only).
 * @target clearButton The Remove button of the preview (one file only).
 * @target list        The list of picked files (several files only).
 * @action dragOver    Marks the element `data-dragging`, and refuses a drop outside the input.
 * @action dragLeave   Removes `data-dragging` once the drag leaves the element.
 * @action drop        Removes `data-dragging`, and refuses a drop outside the input.
 * @action remember    Records whether the input has focus, before a pick hides it (on `change`, in the capture phase).
 * @action changed     Focuses the Remove button after a pick made from the focused input (`dropzone:change`).
 * @action clearing    Records that the Remove button was clicked (in the capture phase).
 * @action cleared     Focuses the input after the Remove button cleared the pick (`dropzone:clear`).
 * @action removing    Records which file's Remove button was clicked (in the capture phase).
 * @action removed     Focuses the Remove button now at that place, else the last one, else the input (`dropzone:remove`).
 * @action cache       On `turbo:before-cache`: keeps the file of a zone in a form that is not a GET form for the copy.
