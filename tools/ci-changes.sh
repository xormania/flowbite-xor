# `<job>=true|false` line per job of .github/workflows/ci.yml, for $GITHUB_OUTPUT. A job is skipped only when none of
# the paths could change what it checks. A path not listed counts as part of the kit, which runs every job but
# Contrast and Workflows (a recipe's templates and markdown run Contrast too). A workflow runs Workflows (actionlint)
# and the jobs that run the same commands it runs; a workflow or a file under .github/ that is not listed runs
