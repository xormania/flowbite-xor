# Form theme

A Symfony form theme that renders every row through `FormField` and every control through the kit's `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Label` and `Button` components.

## Installation

::: installation

## Usage

Use it for every form of the application in `config/packages/twig.yaml`:

```yaml
twig:
    form_themes: ['form/flowbite_layout.html.twig']
```

or for one form:

```twig
{% form_theme form 'form/flowbite_layout.html.twig' %}
{{ form(form) }}
```

What it renders:

- **Rows**: a `FormField` with the label, the control, the help text (`<id>_help`) and the errors (`<id>_error`). The control gets `aria-describedby` pointing at both, and `aria-invalid="true"` when there are errors. Required fields get a marker on the label.
- **Groups**: expanded choices (radios, checkboxes), dates in three selects and sub-forms are a `fieldset` whose `legend` is the label.
- **Controls**: text-like types through `Input`, `textarea` through `Textarea`, collapsed choices through `Select`, checkboxes and radios through `Checkbox`/`Radio` with a `Label`, buttons through `Button`. To pick a `Button` variant, give the button field `'attr' => ['variant' => 'outline']` in the form type, or `attr: {variant: 'outline'}` in Twig.
- **Autocomplete**: a choice field with `'autocomplete' => true` (symfony/ux-autocomplete) renders through `Select` with UX Autocomplete's controller, the `autocomplete` recipe's `autocomplete-assist` next to it (Tom Select shows the choice a form reset puts back) and the label's name kept for Tom Select; see the [`autocomplete` README](../autocomplete/README.md#in-a-symfony-form).
- **Date picker**: with the `date-picker` recipe installed, a `DateType` with `'widget' => 'single_text'` and `'block_prefix' => 'flowbite_date_picker'` renders as a typed field with a calendar in a popover; see the [`date-picker` README](../date-picker/README.md#with-a-symfony-form). Without the opt-in it stays a native `<input type="date">`.
- **File uploads**: with the `dropzone` recipe installed, every `DropzoneType` (symfony/ux-dropzone) renders as the recipe's `Dropzone`, never as UX Dropzone's own form theme (whose `style` attributes break a strict Content Security Policy); see the [`dropzone` README](../dropzone/README.md#in-a-symfony-form). A plain `FileType` stays a native `<input type="file">`.
- **Rich text**: with the `editor` recipe installed, its `EditorType` renders as a formatting toolbar over an editable area; see the [`editor` README](../editor/README.md#usage). With the `markdown-editor` recipe, its `MarkdownType` renders as a Markdown textarea with a server-rendered preview; see the [`markdown-editor` README](../markdown-editor/README.md#usage).
- Everything else (hidden, range, color, collections) falls back to Symfony's `tailwind_2_layout.html.twig`.

The theme only arranges components: their classes stay in the component templates, so a form and a hand-written page look the same.

### With a Live Component

A form in a Live Component (`ComponentWithFormTrait`) re-renders through the same theme; errors appear on the fields the user has changed:

```php
// src/Twig/Components/ProfileForm.php
#[AsLiveComponent]
final class ProfileForm extends AbstractController
{
    use ComponentWithFormTrait;
    use DefaultActionTrait;

    protected function instantiateForm(): FormInterface
    {
        return $this->createForm(ProfileType::class);
    }

    #[LiveAction]
    public function save(): void
    {
        $this->submitForm();
        // ... persist $this->getForm()->getData()
    }
}
```

```twig
{# templates/components/ProfileForm.html.twig #}
<div {{ attributes }}>
    {{ form_start(form, {attr: {'data-action': 'live#action:prevent', 'data-live-action-param': 'save', novalidate: true}}) }}
        {{ form_row(form.name) }}
        {{ form_row(form.email) }}
        <twig:Button type="submit">Save</twig:Button>
    {{ form_end(form) }}
</div>
```
