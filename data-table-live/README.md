# Data Table Live

The `data-table` recipe as a Live Component: search while typing, filters, sortable columns, pages and row selection, without page reloads.

```twig {"preview":true}
<twig:OrdersTable tableId="orders" label="Orders" />
```

## Installation

::: installation

Run `ux:install` from your project's root directory: this recipe copies `AbstractLiveDataTable` into
`src/FlowbiteXor/DataTableLive/` (namespace `App\FlowbiteXor\DataTableLive`), and installs the `data-table` recipe,
whose classes it extends. If your project's root namespace is not `App`, change the `namespace` and `use` lines of
those files to match.

## Usage

A Live table is the class a `data-table` table would be, extending `AbstractLiveDataTable` instead of
`AbstractDataTable`, with the `#[AsLiveComponent]` attribute naming the component and this recipe's template.
`columns()`, `filters()`, `pageSizes()`, `defaultSort()`, `rowId()` and `loadPage()` work as the `data-table` README
describes: moving a table from one recipe to the other changes its parent class and its attribute only.

```php
// src/Twig/Components/OrdersTable.php
namespace App\Twig\Components;

use App\FlowbiteXor\DataTable\Column;
use App\FlowbiteXor\DataTable\TableQuery;
use App\FlowbiteXor\DataTable\TableResult;
use App\FlowbiteXor\DataTableLive\AbstractLiveDataTable;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\AsLiveComponent;

#[AsLiveComponent(name: 'OrdersTable', template: 'components/DataTableLive.html.twig')]
final class OrdersTable extends AbstractLiveDataTable
{
    public function __construct(private readonly OrderRepository $orders)
    {
    }

    public function columns(): array
    {
        return [Column::make('number', 'Order')->sortable('o.number'), Column::make('status', 'Status')];
    }

    protected function loadPage(TableQuery $query): TableResult
    {
        return $this->orders->findPage($query); // as in the data-table README
    }
}
```

Render it anywhere, with no controller code: the component reads its state from the URL and loads its rows.

```twig
<twig:OrdersTable tableId="orders" label="Orders" />
```

`tableId` prefixes the rows' element ids (`orders-row-<row id>`): give each table on a page its own. Cells render
`row.<key>` unless you pass a `<twig:block name="cell_<key>">`, as with `data-table`. Write those blocks in a template
file: Live Components render them again from it on each update, and a template built from a string (Twig's
`template_from_string()`) cannot be found again.

### Selection and bulk actions

Each row has a checkbox; the ids of the selected rows are in `$this->selectedIds` (strings), on every page: a
filter, a sort or another page keeps them. "Select this page" adds the rows of the current page. Override
`selectable()` to return `false` for a table without selection.

A bulk action is a `#[LiveAction]` of your class. The ids come from the browser: check that the user may act on each
one.

```php
#[LiveAction]
public function archiveSelected(): void
{
    // $this->security: Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Security, injected in the constructor
    foreach ($this->orders->findBy(['id' => $this->selectedIds, 'owner' => $this->security->getUser()]) as $order) {
        $order->archive();
    }
    $this->selectedIds = [];
}
```

Its button goes in the `selection_actions` block, shown while rows are selected:

```twig
<twig:OrdersTable tableId="orders" label="Orders">
    <twig:block name="selection_actions">
        <twig:Button size="xs" variant="danger" data-action="live#action" data-live-action-param="archiveSelected">Archive</twig:Button>
    </twig:block>
</twig:OrdersTable>
```

### URL, history and Turbo

The search, filters, sort, page and page size are in the URL, with the parameter names of `data-table` (`q`, `f`,
`sort`, `dir`, `page`, `size`), and every value is checked as `data-table` checks it. Live Components replace the URL
without adding a history entry: Back leaves the page, and coming back, or reloading, or opening a copied URL, shows
the same state. The selection is not in the URL. For Back and Forward through every state, use the `data-table`
recipe in its Turbo Frame.

One table per page: the URL parameters are not prefixed (`paramPrefix()` does not apply to a Live table).

The table keeps working through Turbo visits, inside a Turbo Frame, inside a `data-turbo-permanent` element (it keeps
its state across visits) and after a Turbo Stream replaces or updates it (it starts again from the state the stream
rendered). Give a region one owner: let Live re-render the table, or replace it with a Turbo Frame or Stream, not both
at once. Turbo 8's refresh with morphing is not supported.
